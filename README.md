## To-Do List
- Animal Classfication
- Background Subtraction solution(the given algirithm of BS is not good enough)

## Project Log

**2018/12/06**
- Using HOG and SVM to do animal recognition, but didn't have very good performance


**2018/12/07**
- Finishing using KNN to classify 2 types of animals WP and DC (but only have 65% of accuracy)
Reasoning:
- The training data has too much noise

**2018/12/15**
- Finish do the data augmentation (see file img_aug_success.py)
- Build a simple neural network for training (but the validation accuracy is changing a lot during the training) (see the Training.ipynb)
